# Show Hooks

This is a small Click-based module to track and show the names of all hooks/filters which executed during a page cycle.

Convenient for development purposes in case you are having trouble understanding the name or execution order of WP events.

Events are shown only once in the list, the FIRST time they are seen. If they are fired again subsequently, they will not show in the list.
